<p>During POLL NOW, the app starts from the 1st event that it can query up to "Maximum events" configured.</p>
<p>During scheduled polls, the app starts from the 1st event that it can query up to "Maximum events" configured, but then remembers the last event that it queried for. In the next scheduled poll, it will start from the last event.</p>
<p>
The default behavior of the app is that each event will be placed in its own container.
By checking "Merge containers for Hostname and Eventname" as well as specifying an interval, all events which are of the same type and on the same host will be put into one container, as long as the time between those two events is less than the interval.</p>
</p>
<p>
The DetectionSummaryEvent is parsed to extract the following values into an Artifact
<table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
        <td><b>Artifact Field</b></td>
        <td><b>Event Field</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cef.sourceUserName</td>
        <td>UserName</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cef.fileName</td>
        <td>FileName</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cef.filePath</td>
        <td>FilePath</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cef.sourceHostName</td>
        <td>ComputerName</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cef.sourceNtDomain</td>
        <td>MachineDomain</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cef.hash</td>
        <td>MD5String</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cef.hash</td>
        <td>SHA1String</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cef.hash</td>
        <td>SHA256STring</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cef.cs1</td>
        <td>cmdLine</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
The App also parses the following <b>sub events</b> into their own Artifacts
<ul>
  <li>Documents Accessed</li>
  <li>Executables Written</li>
  <li>Network Access</li>
  <li>Scan Result</li>
  <li>Quarantine Files</li>
  <li>Dns Requests</li>
</ul>
Each of the sub events has a cef key called <b>parentSdi</b> that stands for Parent Source Data Identifier. This is the value of the SDI of the main event that the sub events were generated from.
</p>
<h2 id="appid">App ID</h2>
<p>
Optionally, you can specify an <b>App ID</b> to be used with the Streaming API. If one isn't set, it will default to the asset id.<br>
It is recommended to have a unique <b>App ID</b> for each connection to the Streaming API. That is to say, if you are planning on having multiple assets using the Streaming API at once, you should give them unique App IDs.
